This app was created as part of a challenge project during an interview, where I achieved a 98% skill test score. The app is built using Kotlin and Android Studio, and provides a seamless user experience for football enthusiasts to find information about their favorite clubs.\nDescription of the task You are required to implement an Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose described by the speci;ications below. You are not allowed to use third-party libraries. The only libraries that you can use are the standard Android API libraries found in the following URL (with the exception of Views that you should NOT use): h\u0026quot;ps://developer.android.com/reference/ It is important to follow exactly the speciGications and your implementation must conform to these: The application developed will be helping users to obtain information about football clubs. The application will be using the h\u0026quot;ps://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php/ Web service and the Room Library to save information about clubs.\nWhen the application starts, it presents the user with 3 buttons labelled Add Leagues to DB, Search for Clubs By League and Search for Clubs. (2 marks) â€¢ Clicking on the Add Leagues to DB button saves all the details of a few football leagues (from different countries) in an SQLite database which is local to the mobile device using the Room library. The speci;ic information of the leagues which will be saved is shown in the following link and the information saved could simply be hardcoded in the application. h\u0026quot;ps://ddracopo.github.io/DOCUM/courses/5cosc023w/football_leagues.txt An appropriate database with appropriate tables should be created and populated by your application, based on the above data. Features Search Football Clubs: Users can search for football clubs using the app\u0026rsquo;s intuitive search functionality. Library Database: The app utilizes a library database to store and retrieve information about football clubs. User-friendly Interface: Simple and clean interface for easy navigation and usage.
